- In some cases, frequently multi-page apps, the `dcc.Graph` interactive properties
will stop working (`selectedData`, `hoverData`, `relayoutData`). This should be fixed now. https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/178
- `dcc.Graph` will now resize after it it plotted for the first time. This should fix issues
where the `dcc.Graph` component was not fitting to the size of its container. https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/178

## [0.21.0] - 2018-03-12
### Added
- Upgraded Plotly.js, the underlying library behind the
`dash_core_components.Graph` component, to [version 1.35.2](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.34.0).
See https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.35.2 for the official notes.

## [0.20.0] - 2018-03-01
### Added
- Upgraded Plotly.js, the underlying library behind the
`dash_core_components.Graph` component, to [version 1.34.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.34.0).

   `area`) are now deprecated).

### Fixed
- Several bugs with the `dcc.Graph` component were fixed with the plotly.js upgrade.

    - Fix `scattergl` marker.colorscale handling [plotly.js/pull/2258](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2258)
    - Fix decimal and thousands settings in `de` locale [plotly.js/pull/2246](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2246)
    - Make scroll handler _passive_, removing those annoying console warnings [plotly.js/pull/2251](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2251)

## [0.17.1] - 2017-01-18
### Fixed
- Previously, if `None` is supplied to `SyntaxHighlighter` or `Markdown`, the
component would not render and the app would break. This is problematic because
if `children` isn't supplied (as done in the case for when you are updating that
property from a callback), `None` is the default property. Fixes https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/147. This bug was introduced in
v0.15.4.

## [0.17.0] - 2017-01-11
### Added
- The `dcc.Graph` component now includes `pointNumbers` inside `selectedData`
and `hoverData` if the chart type is a `histogram`, `histogram2d`, or `histogram2dcontour`.

## [0.16.0] - 2017-01-11
### Added
- Upgraded Plotly.js, the underlying library behind the
`dash_core_components.Graph` component, to [version 1.32.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.32.0).
This was a huge release! Here are some of the new features that
are available. See https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.32.0 for the official notes.
- Add localization machinery  [https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2195, https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2207, https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2210, https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2232],

- Fix colorbar class name [https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2139]



## [0.15.5] - 2017-01-08
### Fixed
- The `dash_core_components.Location` and `dash_core_components.Link` properties
should now work on Internet Explorer.
Thanks to @nedned for suggesting a solution.
Fixes https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/113

## [0.15.4] - 2017-12-21
### Changed
- The `dash_core_components.Location` component now supports `hash`,
`href`, and `search` in addition to the already supported `pathname`
(mimicking the `window.location` API). `href` can be used to handle
`pathname`, `hash`, and `search` in aggregate, or each can be manipulated
independently.
- The `children` property of `dash_core_components.Markdown` and
`dash_core_components.SyntaxHighlighter` now accepts an
array of strings (previously it *had* to be a string). Now,
if an array is provided, it is collapsed into a string with line
breaks (see #134).

## [0.15.3] - 2017-12-11
### Fixed
- Upgrade the version of [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) from 1.31.0 to 1.31.2. See the list of fixes here: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md


## [0.15.2] - 2017-11-24
### :sweat_smile: Added
- The `Interval` component has a new property: `n_intervals`. This is an
integer that increases every time that the interval passes. This allows you
to use the `Interval` component without using the `events=[Event(...)]` pattern
inside the callback.

This is similar to the `n_clicks` property of the `dash_html_components`
components.
This was the last use case for `events=[Event(...)]` inside the
`dash_core_components` library. Ultimately, we may be able to deprecate this
pattern.

### Changed
- The `dash_core_components.Input(type='number')` component actually converts
the values to floats or integers, instead of passing the numbers back as strings.
https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/100
Big thanks to community contributor @Madhu94!

### Fixed
- The `disable_click` property in the `dcc.Upload` component now works.
https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/106.
Big thanks to community contributor @Akronix!
- Several properties in several components had the wrong `propTypes`.
This has been fixed, improving the documentation for the Dash python classes
(and removing warnings in JS development).
Big thanks to community contributor @Akronix!

## [0.12.7] - 2017-09-26
### :bug: Fixed
- Fixed issues related to updating the `max_date_allowed` property of `DatePickerSingle` and `DatePickerRange`  programmatically through callbacks
- Clicking on the end date in the `DatePickerRange` will now open up the calendar to the end date (https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/80)

### Maintenance
- Cleaned up `DatePickerSingle` and `DatePickerRange`

## [0.12.6] - 2017-09-11
### :bug: Fixed
-  Non-ascii characters, like chinese characters, are now supported as
   search strings in the `dcc.Dropdown` component (https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/75)

## [0.12.5] - 2017-09-11
### :bug: Fixed
-  The `Interval` component was constantly resetting its interval on every update. Initially reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/multiple-interval-object-in-a-single-page/5699/3
- Removed the used `label` property from the `Slider` component
- Provide a more descriptive documentation for the `marks` property of the `Slider` component

### :stars: Added
- A `disabled` property on the `Interval` component will disable the interval component from firing its updates.

## [0.12.4] - 2017-08-18
### Added
- Added `className` and `style` properties to the parent `div`s of the `Checklist`, `Dropdown`, `Graph` and `RadioItems` component. As requested in https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/57, solved in https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/60

## [0.12.3] - 2017-08-17
### Fixed
- Previously, the `max_date_allowed` could not be selected. This issue has been fixed, issue first reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/solved-datepicker-in-dash/4816/10

## [0.12.2] - 2017-08-10
### Fixed
- Previously, when the `options` of a `dcc.Dropdown` would change, the options would no longer be searchable. That has been fixed. Issue was originally reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/dropdown-not-searching-values-when-typing/5323/3

## [0.12.1] - 2017-08-09
### Fixed
- Disabled portal settings on `dcc.DatePickerSingle` and `dcc.DatePickerRange` when `vertical=True`. `with_portal` and `with_full_screen_portal` will only apply if `vertical=False`.

## [0.12.0] - 2017-08-09
### Added
- Added two new date picker components: `dcc.DatePickerSingle` and `dcc.DatePickerRange`

## [0.11.1] - 2017-08-07
### Fixed
- Added support for all of the valid HTML attributes of the `Input` component.
- Added support for a few more `type` values of the `Input` component. The
  full list of valid types are 'text', 'number', 'password', 'email', 'range', 'search', 'tel', 'url', 'hidden'.
  Note that type values that don't have cross-browser support are not included (such as `datetime`)

## [0.11.0] - 2017-08-04
### Added
- The `Dropdown` component renders `options` much, much faster. It can render 50,000 options (client-side) without crashing! This fixes https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/103

## [0.10.0] - 2017-08-03
### Added
- Upgrade [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) (the library behind the `Graph` component) from 1.27.0 to 1.29.3. This includes TONS of fixes and improvements, see https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases for more details. Notable improvements include:
    - Add touch interactions to cartesian, gl2d and ternary subplots including for
    select and lasso drag modes
    - Add support for contour line labels in contour and contourcarpet traces
    - Add support for select and lasso drag modes on scattermapbox traces
    - Add reset view and toggle hover mode bar buttons to mapbox subplots
    - Add support for array marker.opacity settings in scattermapbox traces
    - Add namelength layout and trace attribute to control the trace name's
    visible length in hover labels
    - Add cliponaxis attribute to scatter and scatterternary traces to allow
    markers and text nodes to be displayed above their subplot's axes
    - Add axis layer attribute with 'above traces' and 'below traces' values

    And fixes include:
    - Fix axis line width, length, and positioning for coupled subplots
    - Fix alignment of cartesian tick labels
    - Fix rendering and updates of overlaying axis lines
    - Fix hover for 2D traces with custom colorbar tickvals
    - Fix hover and event data for heatmapgl and contourgl traces
    - Fix event data for pie and sankey traces
    - Fix drag mode 'pan' in IE and Edge
    - Fix bar, error bar and box point scaling on scroll zoom
    - Fix shading issue in surface trace in iOS
    - Fix lasso and select drag modes for `scatterternary` traces
    - Fix cases of intersecting contour lines on log axes
    - Fix animation of annotations, shapes and images
    - Fix histogram bin computation when more than 5000 bins are needed
    - Fix tick label rendering when more than 1000 labels are present

## [0.9.0] - 2017-07-28
### Added
- A `config` property of the `Graph` component that exposes the [plotly.js config properties](https://plot.ly/javascript/configuration-options/). Here's an example that hides 2 buttons and makes the elements in the graph "editable":
```
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html

app = dash.Dash()

app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Graph(
        id='my-graph',
        figure={'data': [{'x': [1, 2, 3]}]},
        config={'editable': True, 'modeBarButtonsToRemove': ['pan2d', 'lasso2d']}
    )
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

## [0.8.0] - 2017-07-27
### Added
- A new `Textarea` component for displaying the simple Textarea HTML element. The content of the `Textarea` is controlled through the `value` property:
```
dcc.Textarea(id='my-text-area' value='''
SELECT * FROM MY_TABLES
LIMIT 10;
''')
```

## [0.7.1] - 2017-07-24
### Fixed
- Clearing a Graph selection box sets the `selectedData` value to `None` (`null` in JavaScript). Before, it didn't change the `selectedData` property, preventing the user and the Dash developer from clearing selections. Fixes https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/97, thanks to @pmbaumgartner for reporting.


## [0.7.0] - 2017-07-20
### Added
- The `clearable` property to the `Dropdown`, which toggles on and off the "x" on the side of the dropdown that clears the current selection.
- The `searchable` property to the `Dropdown`, which toggles on and off whether the `Dropdown` is searchable.

### Fixed
- Clicking on the little `x` on the side of the Dropdown to clear the currently selected value didn't work. Now it does. If `multi=false`, then `null` (or Python's `None`) is set. If `multi=True`, then `[]` is set.

## [0.6.0] - 2017-07-18
### Added
- The `Slider` and the `RangeSlider` component can update when the user finishes dragging the slider rather than just while they drag. The default behaviour has remained the same (updates while dragging) but you can toggle that the updates only get fired on "mouse up" by setting `updatemode` to `'mouseup'` (`'drag'` is the default).
- A `Link` and `Location` were added. `Location` represents the address bar of the web browser and `Link` provides a way to modify the address bar without refreshing the page. Combined, these two components can be used to create a "single page app" with multiple URLs. That is, apps that have mulitple URLs but surfing between the different pages doesn't trigger a full page refresh like it would with traditional links.
- Previously, if callback functions weren't supplied to a component, it wouldn't update. This caused a lot of confusion: users would create a simple layout without any callbacks and then wonder why the sliders wouldn't slide or the text inputs wouldn't update. Now, all of the components manage their own state and their appearance will update regardless of whether Dash has assigned a callback to them.

## [0.5.3] - 2017-07-03
### Added
- A `range` object is now included in the `selectedData` object that specifies
  that dimensions of the selected region.
- A `lassoPoints` object is now included in the `selectedData` object that
  provides coordinates of the lassoed region.

## [0.5.2] - 2017-07-03
### Added
- A new property `clear_on_unhover` on the `Graph` component will clear the
  `hoverData` property when the user "unhovers" from a point if True. If False,
  then the `hoverData` property will be equal to the data from the last point
  that was hovered over. The default is False.
