# Change Log for dash-core-components
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Ability to add tooltips to `Slider` and `RangeSlider`, which can be visible always or on hover. Tooltips also take a position argument. [#564](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/564)

### Fixed
- Fixed `min_date_allowed` and `max_date_allowed` bug in `DatePickerRange` [#551]https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/551)
- Fixed unwanted `resize()` calls on unmounted `Graph`s [#534](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/534)

### Changed
- Changed `dcc.Checklist` prop `values` to `value`, to match all the other input components [#558](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/558). Also improved prop types for `Dropdown` and `RadioItems` `value` props to consistently accept both strings and numbers.

## [0.48.0] - 2019-05-15
### Added
- `figure` prop in `dcc.Graph` now accepts a `frames` key
- Improved the `Dropdown` options description for dash-docs [#547](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/547)
- Added `optionHeight` prop to `Dropdown` [#552](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/552)

### Removed
- Removed unused `key` prop from `dcc.ConfirmDialog`

## [0.47.0] - 2019-04-25
### Fixed
- Fixed style regression in DatePickerSingle and DatePickerRange [#518](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/518)
- **Breaking** - In `dcc.Input`, fixed several HTML properties that weren't properly camel cased and therefore were not actually applied in the DOM [#523](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/523/):
    - `autocomplete` is now `autoComplete`
    - `autofocus` is now `autoFocus`
    - `inputmode` is now `inputMode`
    - `maxlength` is now `maxLength`
    - `minlength` is now `minLength`
- Improved property definitions of various components in anticipation of upcoming component validation (https://github.com/plotly/dash-renderer/pull/100/). [#523](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/523/)
- **Breaking** - `n_blur_timestamp` & `n_submit_timestamp` in `Input` & `Textarea` is now a number instead of a date object/string. This matches the form of `n_clicks_timestamp` as used in `dash_html_components`. [#523](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/523/)
- Fixed an issue with `ConfirmDialog` that could display multiple confirm popups instead of a single popup in certain contexts. [#523](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/523/)
- `dcc.Markdown` `containerProps` is now applied to the component's container again. This was broken in 0.45.0's `react-markdown` upgrade.

### Changed
- `dcc.Interval` will reset its timer when re-enabled. Previously, if the `dcc.Interval` was disabled, it's "clock would keep running": when it was reenabled, it would fire at the next `interval` on the previous clock's schedule, rather than `interval` milliseconds later. For example, previously the schedule might look like this:
    ```
    0 seconds: interval started with `interval=5000`
    5 seconds: `n_intervals=1`
    7 seconds: callback sets `disabled=True`
    10 seconds: interval continues to run, but doesn't fire an update
    13 seconds: callback sets `disabled=False`
    15 seconds: interval fires an update: `n_intervals=2`
    ```

    Now, it will look like this:
    ```
    0 seconds: interval started with `interval=5000`
    5 seconds: `n_intervals=1`
    7 seconds: callback sets `disabled=True` - interval stops
    13 seconds: callback sets `disabled=False` - clock resets
    18 seconds: interval fires an update: `n_intervals=2`
    ```

## [0.46.0] - 2019-04-10
### Added
- `extendData` prop for `Graph` component. This feeds `Plotly.extendTraces` for incremental data updates. [#461](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/461)

### Fixed
- Various bugs with the `ohlc` and `candlestick` chart type in the `dcc.Graph`
component were fixed. See https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/184.

## [0.22.0] - 2018-04-03
### Added

https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/177

## [0.21.1] - 2018-03-28
### Fixed
- In some cases, frequently multi-page apps, the `dcc.Graph` interactive properties
will stop working (`selectedData`, `hoverData`, `relayoutData`). This should be fixed now. https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/178
- `dcc.Graph` will now resize after it it plotted for the first time. This should fix issues
where the `dcc.Graph` component was not fitting to the size of its container. https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/178

## [0.21.0] - 2018-03-12
### Updated
- Upgraded Plotly.js, the underlying library behind the
`dash_core_components.Graph` component, to version 1.35.2 [#174](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/174). This includes [Feature release 1.35.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.35.0) and patch releases [1.35.2](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.35.2), [1.35.1](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.35.1), which contain:
  - An `automargin` attribute for cartesian axes with long tick labels
  - Support for typed arrays as data inputs
  - layout `grid` attribute for easy subplot generation
  - And numerous other features and bug fixes

## [0.20.2] - 2018-03-05
### Fixed
- The `selectedData`, `clickData`, and `hoverData` callbacks were being attached without being
removed every time the graph was updated. They are now removed and reattached. #172

## [0.20.1] - 2018-03-01
### Fixed
- The `serve_locally` was broken - the Plotly.js bundle wasn't being served correctly.

## [0.20.0] - 2018-03-01
### Updated
- Upgraded plotly.js, the underlying library behind the
`dash_core_components.Graph` component, to version 1.34.0 [#170](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/170). [Feature release 1.34.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.34.0) contains:
  - `Plotly.react`, a new do-it-all API method that creates and updates graphs using the same API signature
  - Constraint-type contours in `contour` traces
  - `notched` `box` traces
  - Localization machinery for auto-formatted date axis ticks
  - And many other features and bug fixes

## [0.19.0] - 2018-02-11

### Fixed
- Patched plotly.js to version 1.33.1 [#151](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/151). [Patch release 1.33.1](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.33.1) includes numerous bug fixes.

## [0.18.0] - 2017-01-19
### Updated
- Upgraded Plotly.js, the underlying library behind the `dash_core_components.Graph` component, to [version 1.33.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.33.0). This was a huge release! Here are some of the new features that are available:
  - Completely rewritten `scattergl` trace type using `regl` [plotly.js#2258](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2258)
  - Completely rewritten polar chart renderer accompanied by new `scatterpolar` and `scatterpolargl` trace types [plotly.js#2200](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2200). The old polar trace types - `scatter` with `(r, t)` coordinates, bar with `(r, t)` coordinates, and `area` - are now deprecated.
  - Add the ability to draw layout images and layout shapes on subplot with `scattergl` traces [plotly.js#2258](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2258)
  - Add `fill` capabilities to `scattergl` traces [plotly.js#2258](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2258)

  - Add official French translation (locale `fr`) [plotly.js#2252](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2252)
  - And numerous other features and bug fixes
  - Many of these features were funded directly by companies that rely on this library. If your organization or company would like to sponsor particular features or bug fixes in these open source libraries, please reach out: http://plot.ly/products/consulting-and-oem

## [0.17.1] - 2017-01-18
### Fixed
- Previously, if `None` is supplied to `SyntaxHighlighter` or `Markdown`, the
component would not render and the app would break. This is problematic because
if `children` isn't supplied (as done in the case for when you are updating that
property from a callback), `None` is the default property. Fixes https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/147. This bug was introduced in
v0.15.4.

## [0.17.0] - 2017-01-11
### Added
- The `dcc.Graph` component now includes `pointNumbers` inside `selectedData`
and `hoverData` if the chart type is a `histogram`, `histogram2d`, or `histogram2dcontour`.

## [0.16.0] - 2017-01-11
### Updated
- Upgraded Plotly.js, the underlying library behind the `dash_core_components.Graph` component, to version 1.32.0 [#143](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/143). [Feature release 1.32.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.32.0) includes:
  - Localization machinery, including an official German translation (locale `de`)
  - A new `violin` trace type
  - Selection improvements: `selected` and `unselected` attribute containers to customize selection states, Support for multi-selections, persistent selections.
  - `colorway` attribute to customize the trace-to-trace color sequence
  - Add `tickformatstops` to set tick format per cartesian axis range
  - And many more features and bug fixes

## [0.15.5] - 2017-01-08
### Fixed
- The `dash_core_components.Location` and `dash_core_components.Link` properties
should now work on Internet Explorer.
Thanks to @nedned for suggesting a solution.
Fixes https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/113

## [0.15.4] - 2017-12-21
### Changed
- The `dash_core_components.Location` component now supports `hash`,
`href`, and `search` in addition to the already supported `pathname`
(mimicking the `window.location` API). `href` can be used to handle
`pathname`, `hash`, and `search` in aggregate, or each can be manipulated
independently.
- The `children` property of `dash_core_components.Markdown` and
`dash_core_components.SyntaxHighlighter` now accepts an
array of strings (previously it *had* to be a string). Now,
if an array is provided, it is collapsed into a string with line
breaks (see #134).

## [0.15.3] - 2017-12-11
### Fixed
- Patched plotly.js to version 1.31.2 [#125](https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/125), including patch releases [1.31.2](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.31.2) and [1.31.1](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.31.1) with numerous bug fixes.


## [0.15.2] - 2017-11-24
### :sweat_smile: Added
- The `Interval` component has a new property: `n_intervals`. This is an
integer that increases every time that the interval passes. This allows you
to use the `Interval` component without using the `events=[Event(...)]` pattern
inside the callback.

This is similar to the `n_clicks` property of the `dash_html_components`
components.
This was the last use case for `events=[Event(...)]` inside the
`dash_core_components` library. Ultimately, we may be able to deprecate this
pattern.

### Changed
- The `dash_core_components.Input(type='number')` component actually converts
the values to floats or integers, instead of passing the numbers back as strings.
https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/100
Big thanks to community contributor @Madhu94!

### Fixed
- The `disable_click` property in the `dcc.Upload` component now works.
https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/106.
Big thanks to community contributor @Akronix!
- Several properties in several components had the wrong `propTypes`.
This has been fixed, improving the documentation for the Dash python classes
(and removing warnings in JS development).
Big thanks to community contributor @Akronix!

## [0.15.1] - 2017-11-23
### Fixed
- Attempt to fix the JS builds from 0.15.0 but actually nothing changed.

## [0.15.0] - 2017-11-19
- Bad build. See 0.15.2 for the correct build

## [0.14.0] - 2017-10-17
### :sparkles: Added
- An `Upload` component! :tada: See [https://plot.ly/dash/dash-core-components/upload](https://plot.ly/dash/dash-core-components/upload) for docs.

## [0.13.0] - 2017-10-05
### Updated
- Upgraded plotly.js to version 1.31.0. This includes:
  - Two huge feature releases by the plotly.js team! :clap: - [1.31.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.31.0) and [1.30.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.30.0), which contain:
    - A new `table` trace type
    - `geo.center` making geo views fully reproducible
    - Extend lasso and select-box drag modes to `bar`, `histogram`, `scattergeo`, and `choropleth` trace types
    - `aggregate` transforms
    - And many other features and bug fixes
  - Patch release [1.30.1](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.30.1) with bug fixes

## [0.12.7] - 2017-09-26
### :bug: Fixed
- Fixed issues related to updating the `max_date_allowed` property of `DatePickerSingle` and `DatePickerRange`  programmatically through callbacks
- Clicking on the end date in the `DatePickerRange` will now open up the calendar to the end date (https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/80)

### Maintenance
- Cleaned up `DatePickerSingle` and `DatePickerRange`

## [0.12.6] - 2017-09-11
### :bug: Fixed
-  Non-ascii characters, like chinese characters, are now supported as
   search strings in the `dcc.Dropdown` component (https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/75)

## [0.12.5] - 2017-09-11
### :bug: Fixed
-  The `Interval` component was constantly resetting its interval on every update. Initially reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/multiple-interval-object-in-a-single-page/5699/3
- Removed the used `label` property from the `Slider` component
- Provide a more descriptive documentation for the `marks` property of the `Slider` component

### :stars: Added
- A `disabled` property on the `Interval` component will disable the interval component from firing its updates.

## [0.12.4] - 2017-08-18
### Added
- Added `className` and `style` properties to the parent `div`s of the `Checklist`, `Dropdown`, `Graph` and `RadioItems` component. As requested in https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/issues/57, solved in https://github.com/plotly/dash-core-components/pull/60

## [0.12.3] - 2017-08-17
### Fixed
- Previously, the `max_date_allowed` could not be selected. This issue has been fixed, issue first reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/solved-datepicker-in-dash/4816/10

## [0.12.2] - 2017-08-10
### Fixed
- Previously, when the `options` of a `dcc.Dropdown` would change, the options would no longer be searchable. That has been fixed. Issue was originally reported in https://community.plot.ly/t/dropdown-not-searching-values-when-typing/5323/3

## [0.12.1] - 2017-08-09
### Fixed
- Disabled portal settings on `dcc.DatePickerSingle` and `dcc.DatePickerRange` when `vertical=True`. `with_portal` and `with_full_screen_portal` will only apply if `vertical=False`.

## [0.12.0] - 2017-08-09
### Added
- Added two new date picker components: `dcc.DatePickerSingle` and `dcc.DatePickerRange`

## [0.11.1] - 2017-08-07
### Fixed
- Added support for all of the valid HTML attributes of the `Input` component.
- Added support for a few more `type` values of the `Input` component. The
  full list of valid types are 'text', 'number', 'password', 'email', 'range', 'search', 'tel', 'url', 'hidden'.
  Note that type values that don't have cross-browser support are not included (such as `datetime`)

## [0.11.0] - 2017-08-04
### Added
- The `Dropdown` component renders `options` much, much faster. It can render 50,000 options (client-side) without crashing! This fixes https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/103

## [0.10.0] - 2017-08-03
### Updated
- Upgraded plotly.js to version 1.29.3, including feature releases [1.29.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.29.0) and [1.28.0](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.28.0), and patch releases [1.29.3](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.29.3), [1.29.2](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.29.2), [1.29.1](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.29.1), [1.28.2](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.28.2), [1.28.1](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.28.1), and [1.27.1](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/releases/tag/v1.27.1) This includes TONS of fixes and improvements, notably:
    - Add touch interactions to cartesian, gl2d and ternary subplots including for
    select and lasso drag modes
    - Add support for contour line labels in contour and contourcarpet traces
    - Add support for select and lasso drag modes on scattermapbox traces
    - Add reset view and toggle hover mode bar buttons to mapbox subplots
    - Add support for array marker.opacity settings in scattermapbox traces
    - Add namelength layout and trace attribute to control the trace name's
    visible length in hover labels
    - Add cliponaxis attribute to scatter and scatterternary traces to allow
    markers and text nodes to be displayed above their subplot's axes
    - Add axis layer attribute with 'above traces' and 'below traces' values

## [0.9.0] - 2017-07-28
### Added
- A `config` property of the `Graph` component that exposes the [plotly.js config properties](https://plot.ly/javascript/configuration-options/). Here's an example that hides 2 buttons and makes the elements in the graph "editable":
```
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html

app = dash.Dash()

app.layout = html.Div([
    dcc.Graph(
        id='my-graph',
        figure={'data': [{'x': [1, 2, 3]}]},
        config={'editable': True, 'modeBarButtonsToRemove': ['pan2d', 'lasso2d']}
    )
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

## [0.8.0] - 2017-07-27
### Added
- A new `Textarea` component for displaying the simple Textarea HTML element. The content of the `Textarea` is controlled through the `value` property:
```
dcc.Textarea(id='my-text-area' value='''
SELECT * FROM MY_TABLES
LIMIT 10;
''')
```

## [0.7.1] - 2017-07-24
### Fixed
- Clearing a Graph selection box sets the `selectedData` value to `None` (`null` in JavaScript). Before, it didn't change the `selectedData` property, preventing the user and the Dash developer from clearing selections. Fixes https://github.com/plotly/dash/issues/97, thanks to @pmbaumgartner for reporting.


## [0.7.0] - 2017-07-20
### Added
- The `clearable` property to the `Dropdown`, which toggles on and off the "x" on the side of the dropdown that clears the current selection.
- The `searchable` property to the `Dropdown`, which toggles on and off whether the `Dropdown` is searchable.

### Fixed
- Clicking on the little `x` on the side of the Dropdown to clear the currently selected value didn't work. Now it does. If `multi=false`, then `null` (or Python's `None`) is set. If `multi=True`, then `[]` is set.

## [0.6.0] - 2017-07-18
### Added
- The `Slider` and the `RangeSlider` component can update when the user finishes dragging the slider rather than just while they drag. The default behaviour has remained the same (updates while dragging) but you can toggle that the updates only get fired on "mouse up" by setting `updatemode` to `'mouseup'` (`'drag'` is the default).
- A `Link` and `Location` were added. `Location` represents the address bar of the web browser and `Link` provides a way to modify the address bar without refreshing the page. Combined, these two components can be used to create a "single page app" with multiple URLs. That is, apps that have mulitple URLs but surfing between the different pages doesn't trigger a full page refresh like it would with traditional links.
- Previously, if callback functions weren't supplied to a component, it wouldn't update. This caused a lot of confusion: users would create a simple layout without any callbacks and then wonder why the sliders wouldn't slide or the text inputs wouldn't update. Now, all of the components manage their own state and their appearance will update regardless of whether Dash has assigned a callback to them.

## [0.5.3] - 2017-07-03
### Added
- A `range` object is now included in the `selectedData` object that specifies
  that dimensions of the selected region.
- A `lassoPoints` object is now included in the `selectedData` object that
  provides coordinates of the lassoed region.

## [0.5.2] - 2017-07-03
### Added
- A new property `clear_on_unhover` on the `Graph` component will clear the
  `hoverData` property when the user "unhovers" from a point if True. If False,
  then the `hoverData` property will be equal to the data from the last point
  that was hovered over. The default is False.
