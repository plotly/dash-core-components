A DatePickerRange component.
DatePickerRange is a tailor made component designed for selecting
timespan across multiple days off of a calendar.

The DatePicker integrates well with the Python datetime module with the
startDate and endDate being returned in a string format suitable for
creating datetime objects.

This component is based off of Airbnb's react-dates react component
which can be found here: https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates
